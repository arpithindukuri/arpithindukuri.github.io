It was winter break.

Finals season had just ended.

Fueled by the residual motivation and general fear from the last semester, and inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGMRB4O922I) by Numberphile, I got to work on implementing my own version of the Mandelbrot Set. This is that story.

...once I come back from my nap and finish this up lol...
