This app is like AirBNB for catering.
It allows the user to find, book, and pay caterers in a single easy-to-use interface.
Caterers get an additional funnel to gain customers, and can use the app to manage quotes and bookings.
The app is still in development, and will be ready to use this year.

CaterQuick is built using [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/) (app router).
It uses [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) to provide a sleek, stylish, and user-friendly UI to manage caterer bookings.

On the home screen, you can search for caterers in a city. (The hero image is AI-generated using Midjourney!)

The search results show you a list of caterers in that city, along with ratings and other details.

Clicking on a caterer will take you to their page, where you can see menu items with images and prices, and also request a quote.

Requesting a quote allows you to enter in the event details, and select the menu items you want to order.

When a quote is requested, the caterer gets an email notification (todo), and sees the details entered by the user.

All the data is stored in MongoDB.

I am currently working on the following functionality

- The caterer may then respond with a quote, and the user will be updated with an email notification, using SendGrid.
- If the user agrees to the quote, the caterer will be notified through email, and they can move forward with the event.
- The app will allow you to edit quotes as needed, and will notify both the caterer and the user about any subsequent changes.
- When the event is done, the user will be able to pay for the event through the app, using stripe payments.
- Caterers and users need to be signed in to go through the above process, which will require NextAuth to be implemented.

Although much of the functionality is still in development, I am looking forward to finishing and publishing the site within the next few months!
