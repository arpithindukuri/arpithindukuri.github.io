# About Me

I am a second year software engineering student at the University of Calgary. I enjoy being a nerd, daydreaming about becoming a millionaire, and a good nights sleep (Doesn't happen very often, but I enjoy it).

# About this Blog

This blog is a space for me to share projects I'm working on, or something cool I've learned. 
This site will also double as my portfolio. In fact, considering I'm not a celebrity just yet, you probably got this link off my resume, in which case, welcome! I hope you like what you see here, and feedback will be much appreciated.
