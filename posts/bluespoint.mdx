Bluespoint was a Cybersecurity and Compliance management tool, built on contract as a frontend prototype for [Keyworks](https://keyworks.ca/).
It provides a dashboard to view a companyâ€™s compliance status and various other metrics.

The app included a fully-modular dashboard, allowing the user to drag and drop, resize, and remove modules as needed.

It also provided a list of all controls in a compliance framework, and showed a compliance rating for each.
This required me to build a web scraper to collect information on various cybersecurity compliance frameworks.

The app used the mapbox API to provide GIS functionality, and also provided a host of other user and data management screens.

The final product took many meetings where I met with the clients to ellicit requirements, share progress updates, and collect feedback.
This was an iterative process, which taught me the fundamentals of stakeholder and project management, in addition to many technical React/TypeScript skills.

This was the very first iteration of the dashboard. As you can see, the app progressed a long way since then.
