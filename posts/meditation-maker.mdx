Meditation Maker is a cross platform mobile app used to create custom meditation audios using Text-To-Speech (TTS) technology.
The app was built using Flutter, with a serverless Firebase Functions and Google Cloud Functions backend, using Google Cloud’s TTS API.
The app used Redux for state management, and was custom-designed using state of the art Generative AI tools such as Midjourney.

Opening the app takes you into the home screen. This hero image was generated using Midjourney, and edited on photoshop.

Going into the project list, we can see all the user’s projects, stored locally on their device.

Opening a project allows us to edit the different blocks, adding text which can be spoken out loud, or pauses which simply play silence.

Clicking the play button takes us to this player screen, where we can see the progress of the current block, or skip to next or previous blocks.
