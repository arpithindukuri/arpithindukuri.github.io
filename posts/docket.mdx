This app was meant to be an all-in-one platform for students.
It would provide a calendar for classes and meetings, chatrooms for students of different classes, and todo lists to organize work.

Docket was built with drag and drop in mind.
This required implementation of a custom drag-and-drop library which required knowledge of low-level React and HTML fundamentals.

Docket also included a fully modular dashboard, allowing the user to drag-and-drop, resize, and remove modules.

It was a big accomplishment to make this drag and drop functionality work seamlessly on mobile browsers as well.

This project made me a finalist at the RBC Fast Pitch in 2021.
