This app was meant to be an all-in-one platform for students.
It would provide a calendar for classes and meetings, chatrooms for students of different classes, and todo lists to organize work. Docket was built with drag and drop in mind.
This required implementation of a custom drag-and-drop library which required knowledge of low-level React and HTML fundamentals.
