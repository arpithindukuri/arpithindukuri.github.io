title: Nasa APOD Cache
description:
  A Java server that locally caches NASA's recent Astronomy Pictures Of the Day.
  These images are made available in multiple sizes through a REST API.
  The API is built with Spring Boot, documented with Swagger, and deployed on Azure App Services.

## Introduction

The objective of this project is simply to expand my skillset and give me more experience developing for the web using Java and Azure.
Most of my prior experience has been in front-end development, and I would like to pivot towards working in back-end/cloud systems.
I am also on an internship hunt, so I would like to develop skills that I see often in software intern job descriptions.

I think a good first back-end-y project is building and deploying a simple REST API.
However, I don't have any interesting data to share with the API, so I will use NASA's [Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html) API to collect some cool space pictures.
I will create a server that collects the newest picture from the NASA API every day, and stores it locally.
The server will store the 5 most recent APODs, deleting the oldest one everytime it collects a new one.
The server can receive HTTP requests at any time, and will return the requested APOD in the response.
When the server collects the APOD from the NASA API, it will save multiple different sizes of the same image, so end API users can select the size they want.

This is admittedly a trivial software, but it demonstrates the fundamentals of server file management, API development/documentation/deployment, and codebase management.

I choose to use Java for this project, which is one of the most widely required skills for software interns
I wrote a simple python web scraper that determined this by collecting and analyzing hundreds of jobs.
Link to github: [https://github.com/arpithindukuri/jobscraper](https://github.com/arpithindukuri/jobscraper).
According to my web-scraper, AWS was more popular than Azure services, but a company I am considering an internship with uses Azure, so I choose Azure over AWS so I could be better prepared for the job.
From my research, Spring Boot seems to be the go-to for building web-apps in Java, so I will use it to develop my API, along with Swagger to test and document it.
